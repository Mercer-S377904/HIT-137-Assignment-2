Comparison of SpaCy vs Biobert for Entity Detection 
A direct comparison between BC5CDR and BioBert highlights a disparity between their entity detection capabilities. 
The results from the BC5CDR model indicate that the list of terms the program cross-references against is significantly 
larger than that of the BioBert model. The disparity in specificity between the two models is abundantly clear, as the 
BC5CDR model produces an extraordinarily extensive list of detected entities compared to the BioBert model. However, 
both models appear to run with similar runtime performance characteristics.

The BC5CDR model produces a comprehensive list of detected entities, covering various conditions and ailments within 
the extracted text. Evidently, the model is extraordinarily sensitive compared to the Biobert model, which tends to 
focus on more generalised terms such as “pain”, “chill”, and “nausea”. However, due to the increased sensitivity of 
the BC5CDR model, there is an abundance of detected entities within the list that would not be categorised as diseases 
but instead as symptoms or broader health conditions. This saturation of results with non-disease entities indicates 
that while the BC5CDR model is inclusive, the results do not strictly meet the outlined criteria for disease identification.
