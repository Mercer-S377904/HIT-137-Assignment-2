Important clarrification:
1) due to size and time limitations I created a smaller version of the extracted text
titled "extracted_text_edited.txt". This is the file the majority of the programs
are reading from.
2) Additionally the read and write paths are specific to each pc
3) The 4 .csv files must be placed into a file called 'CSV' and zipped
4) the folder on your desktop should be called Ass-2-Q1 and the contents of the folder should be
    ASS-2-Q1T1
    ASS-2-Q1T2
    ASS-2-Q1T3.1
    ASS-2-Q1T3.2
    ASS-2-Q1T4a
    ASS-2-Q1T4b
    CSV (The zipped CSV folder with the 4 .csv files)
    extracted_text_edited
    Question-1-READ-ME
5) in order for the code to work, everything from Task 2 must be installed
